# TechLabs Learning - BikeSharing Notebook

I built this notebook for the TechLabs Data Science Curriculum, so that students can practice their skills and deepen their knowledge. The notebook uses the Kaggle BikeSharing dataset.

*Feel free to download the notebook and practice yourself.*

Up until this notebook students learned via video tutorials how to explore, clean, and visualize data as well as how to implement supervised and unsupervised machine learning models. Now its time to get your own hands dirty.

In this notebook students are going to combine all these skills and knowledge to build a forecasting project for a bike sharing startup.

## Learning Goals

It is time for you to implement your **frist machine learning (ML) models** from skretch and practice what you have learnt so far. Additionally, the goal of this notebook is to introduce you to a **Data Science Hypothesis Process** which you can use later for your own projects. This process will allow you to make data science projects repeatable by establishing a machine learning strategy instead of a machine learning snapshot.

The notebook is structured in such a way that you will go through a whole data science process. From a short data **exploration** to data **cleaning** and preparation to **formulating hypotheses** and **building ML models** which you then evaluate and refine.
